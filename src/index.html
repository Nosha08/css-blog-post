He enjoyed playing basketball and hanging out with his friends, but most importantly, was spending time with his beloved anime girlfriend. To Evan, she was precious and the sole person that could keep him happy. However, on September 14th at 11:23 AM, crisis struck. Evan had been caught making out with her on the library computer. Both Evan's mother and the school administration took away his love, hope, dreams, and true source of happiness, effictively marking the end of his dream-like relationship with his beloved anime girlfriend.</p>

            <p class="text-[18px] my-6">Since the beginning of his career as a computer science teacher at Staten Island Technical High School, Mr. Whalen has taken his job seriously. So much so that when a student disobeyed his instructions on a hot September day that they wished they chose to take Dr. Frusci's class. This student forgot to save and commit to GitHub within the last five minutes of class and when Mr. Whalen discovered this the consequences were extreme. This student was permanently expelled and banned from ever using a computer again in his life. Mr. Whalen commented that this kid got a generous punishment.</p>
