            <p class="text-[18px] my-6">From the very start of his career as a computer science instructor at Staten Island Technical High School, Mr. Whalen's commitment to his role has been nothing short of exceptional. On a sweltering September day, a pivotal moment unfolded when a student defied his directives. This child, in the final minutes of class, neglected to save and commit their work to GitHub. When Mr. Whalen unearthed this infraction, the repercussions were profound. The consequence for this student was nothing less than severe â€“ a permanent expulsion and a lifetime ban from ever touching a computer again. Mr. Whalen's comment on this matter was profound, deeming the punishment surprisingly light</p>

            <img class="mt-2" src="">
            <p class="text-[18px] my-6">First semester AV for SITHS freshmen was paradise for them. Life seemed simple, relaxed, and completely uncomplicated for these students as they played around with cameras and video editing softwares, fully knowing that no matter what they do they'll still get a nice A+. This fun would last up until the end of January when the lives of these students would change forever. Second semester STEM with Mr. Henriques would be the cause of this. As the students entered STEM for the first time they held a sense of excitement for what awaited them: suffering. For the first time in their lives these poor AV students would struggle, while facing the looming threat of a failing grade. Mr. Henriques enjoyed this and was glad he had the opportunity to teach these freshmen what it actually meant to go to a specialized high school.</p>
